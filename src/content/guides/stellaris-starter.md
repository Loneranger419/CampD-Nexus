## Required Mods

1. **CampD Core Patch** – Internal compatibility layer that aligns checksum requirements and toggles on the shared rule set.
2. **UI Overhaul Dynamic** – Improves ship designer workflows, colony management, and empire overview panels.
3. **CampD Shipset Pack** – Optional cosmetics curated for the current season’s storyline.

## Installation Steps

1. Subscribe to the mods via Steam Workshop (links listed in the official mod list).
2. Launch Stellaris and enable the `CampD Stellaris` playset.
3. Confirm checksum `CD23` before joining the multiplayer lobby.

## Troubleshooting

- **Mismatched checksum**: Ensure that automatic mod updates are enabled and that no local tweaks are overriding load order.
- **Desync after mid-game**: Toggle off experimental AI features and restart from the latest autosave.
