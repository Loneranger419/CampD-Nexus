## Overview

Welcome to the central field guide for the CampD collective. This space gathers the key practices that keep our events running smoothly, whether you're coordinating mods, wrangling admins, or welcoming new players.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Session Lead**: Owns the nightly itinerary, ensures participants have the correct mod packs installed, and records action items that surface during play.
- **Technical Quartermaster**: Maintains mod lists, tests new patches, and updates compatibility notes before community rollout.
- **Comms Relay**: Publishes reminders in Discord, maintains social notifications, and recaps major takeaways after each session.

## Event Cadence

We run two primary event formats:

- **Game Night**: Live play with rotating hosts. Expect curated mod lists announced at least 72 hours ahead of time.
- **Workshop Lab**: Focused experimentation on new mods or balancing ideas. These sessions produce guide updates, screenshots, and lessons learned.

## What To Update

When you wrap a session, document:

1. Patch or mod versions introduced during the night.
2. Any troubleshooting steps that future players should know.
3. Screenshots or media that would improve the public guides.
