We finally have a single launchpad for every CampD project. This site unifies the mod lists, wiki entries, and event recaps that used to live across multiple repositories and shared docs.

### What’s New

- **Structured mod coverage**: Each supported game now has a consistent landing page summarizing the latest mod list and pointing to deeper guides.
- **Living wiki entries**: Operational knowledge, role descriptions, and troubleshooting tips all live under the wiki collection, updated via pull requests or Decap CMS.
- **Built-in change review**: Every content change travels through GitHub, giving us a clean revision history and automatic deployments to GitHub Pages.

### What’s Next

Over the next few weeks we’ll seed the remaining guides, wire up search, and document contributor pathways for new writers. If you’d like to help, grab an issue or drop feedback in the CampD Discord.
